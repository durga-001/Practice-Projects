    <p>Preparing the vegetable balls takes time, as the vegetables need to be finely chopped or shredded, mixed with flours and seasonings, shaped, and fried.
Using a vegetable chopper helps speed up the prep and gives a more even texture. The vegetable balls can also be made ahead, fried in advance, and refrigerated, which reduces last-minute work.
The sauce is flexible and easy to adjust. You can add a little water or vegetable stock for a thinner gravy, or use a small amount of cornstarch slurry for a thicker consistency.</p>
